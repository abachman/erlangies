# Erlangies
I was doing the ErlangDC excercises and like a true rubyist I started by setting up Guard and a test suite (in erlang) so I could TDD the exercises.

Then I learned about [basho/rebar](http://github.com/basho/rebar) and [eunit](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/eunit/chapter.html) so I rewrote the test suite in pure erlang, yay.

No more live watching of tests, since I'm on `make` now.

## Usage

  make test

It doesn't actually run, it's just some libs with tests.
